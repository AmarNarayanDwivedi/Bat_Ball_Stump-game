# Bat_Ball_Stump-game

The Bat Ball Stump Game is a beginner-level browser-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a fun twist on the classic rock-paper-scissors concept by allowing players to choose between Bat, Ball, or Stump to compete against the computer. The project serves as an excellent example of early JavaScript practice, incorporating responsive design and local storage to maintain game scores across sessions.
